I am a doctoral student at Sorbonne University in the SND (Sciences, Normes, Démocratie) group, with Igor Douven as my advisor. I am interested in the principles that guide us in reasoning and belief formation, as well as in the application of empirical findings to empower learners and reasoners to acquire knowledge more reliably and efficiently. I am also interested in the practices that enable scientists to make high quality reproducible science. 

My thesis work is focused on explanatory reasoning and examines how explanatory considerations matter to reasoning in a variety of contexts, ranging from inferences about explanations, to pursuit decisions, the formation of conspiracist beliefs and the semantics of conditionals. Part of this work was done while I served as a visiting student at the [CDD Lab](https://www.cognitionasu.org/) at Arizona State University and at the [Concepts and Cognition Lab](https://cognition.princeton.edu) at Princeton University. 

Finally, I believe that science should be a collaborative and inclusive endeavour, and therefore be truly _open access_: scientific publications, software and data should be open and freely accessible to all, and students and researchers should feel safe and respected as individuals with diverse identities and needs. 


Most of my free time is spent reading books, cooking and trying new foods, and trying to understand better the world and people around me.
